Physical
========
Can be used on and off a wrist strap:
    strap to be easily removable and reinstallable without tools

Vibration spec
==============
It would be helpful to think about modelling this somehow if we want to optimise lifetime and size


Switches/Switching
==================
Way of putting into sync mode (off and on?)
Way of factory-resetting (long press on power button)

Mechanism to change leader <-> follower mode - should not be easy to do accidentally

Probably implementation: 2 buttons- power-on and 

Lifetime: 3 years of 3 uses per day of 20 mins each= 1000 hours

Signalling via leds option
==========================
States that need indicating:
    Battery state:
        indicate that it's charging
        indicate it is fully charged during charging cycle
        indicate that it's a bit low on battery
        indicate forced off as battery nearly completely flat 

    Pairing state
        indicate that it's looking for its partner (syncing)
        indicate it's looking to pair
        indicate it paried Successfully




Battery life
============
Battery life: 4 hours continuous treatment when battery is new
Battery can be replaced when capacity is sufficiently reduced, or knackered through too many too deep discharges
When battery voltage falls below [2.9V?] device should stop and enter permanent deep sleep until charged again
